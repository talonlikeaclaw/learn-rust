# Learn Rust ðŸ¦€

I am learning Rust through a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq56EAYZqGg&list=PLO5VPQH6OWdXR8NlZt0jRbC39W_IyzS-v) and [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) to teach myself a low-level language to better understand memory and system resource management.
Once I finish learning the language and the necessary concepts, I will attempt to finish [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) in order to solidify my understanding of the language.

## Frameworks to Research ðŸ¦€

- [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum): A modern, async web framework built on [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) and [Hyper](https://hyper.rs/), known for type safety, modularity, and ease of use.
- [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.6/): A cross-platform UI framework for building desktop, web, and mobile apps in Rust.
- [Loco](https://loco.rs/): Rails-inspired full-stack web framework for Rust, focused on productivity and convention-over-configuration, making it ideal for CRUD-heavy apps and rapid prototyping.
- [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx): An async, pure Rust SQL toolkit that supports compile-time checked queries and multiple databases, ideal for robust and type-safe data access.
- [Bevy](https://bevy.org/): Rust game engine, built on an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.
- [ggez](github.com/ggez/ggez): Simple, lightweight, and perfect for quick 2D game prototyping or educational projects.
- [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/): Rust library for cooking up delicious TUIs (terminal user interfaces).
